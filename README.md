  My personal Home Assistant configuration

## Why?

Home Assistant is a piece of software to automate and connect smart devices from
different vendors. It's configured through the UI and through Yaml files, with
support for extracting passwords and access tokens.

This means that I can push the config to Github in the hopes that it will be
useful!
